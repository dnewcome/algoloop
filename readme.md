# Algoloop 

Algorithmic music generator in Javascript.

This is a simple toolkit for generating some random notes.
I was using an APC20 to play around with this, so there is code for interfacing with that 
device here. It's not really hooked up yet though.

# Usage:

```
npm install
npm start
```

# TODO:

This is a little proof of concept that spits out MIDI notes. It's not a real thing yet.
